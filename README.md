# Barking Web Service Getting Started Guide

This guide helps developers get started on integrating their system to Barking's SOAP Web Service interface.

Before starting with this guide, make sure you have received the following information/documents:

* BarkingWSImport.wsdl
* Retriever Barking Integration.docx
* URL endpoint for the Barking instance that you will need to connect to

This guide will cover short examples for common Enterprise programming languages:

* [C#](C%23/README.md) 
* [Java](Java/README.md)


Besides the language specific guides, we would recommend using an independent tool like [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/) to test connectivity.


**Note:** This guide will only help you to get started, it is not meant to replace the Retriever Barking Integration document which details the full Web Service interface specification.
